# Weather Fetch

A simple web app to get the weather at a location. Live at https://weather-fetch.herokuapp.com

## Credits

Made from the guide by Brandon Morelli, "Build a Weather Website in 30 minutes with Node.js + Express + OpenWeather" found here:
https://codeburst.io/build-a-weather-website-in-30-minutes-with-node-js-express-openweather-a317f904897b

## Running

Visit the live version. But if you want to run locally, you have to create a .env file and put your OpenWeather API key in the file, as below:
```properties
API_KEY = <key_here>
```

## Purpose

To practise using Node.js and making external API calls. Also practise for publishing to Heroku and hiding API keys through environment variables.
